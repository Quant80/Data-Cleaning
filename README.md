# Data-Cleaning
Importing Data into pandas
1. Write two separate Python programs for each data file below. Each program will read
the corresponding dataset.
CSV: https://campus.contech.university/files/2996/download?download_frd=1
(Dataset info: https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/download/info/
(Links to an external site.)
)
Json file:https://campus.contech.university/files/3008/download?download_frd=1
For each of the data files, your programs will then accomplish and show the result of the
following tasks:
1. View the first few rows. Show the data type for all columns, as well as the
number of rows and columns
2. Find and display the missing values for each data column
3. When appropriate, rename the data columns to better reflect the data in those
columns
4. Remove rows with missing data for a data column (column 'T' in CSV dataset,
'Acceleration' in JSON dataset)
5. Display data types and the non-null count of all data columns
6. Convert the data columns to numeric values
7. Convert all date columns to a date data type
8. Generate summary statistics for all numeric data in the datase
